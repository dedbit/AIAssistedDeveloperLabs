# Create Azure Service principal

**Prerequisites:**

- An Azure Subscription. 

- Owner permissions to the Azure subscription or an Azure Resource Group. 

- You need to have permissions to create 'App registrations' in your AAD (Azure Active Directory Tenant). This is allowed by default, but might have been restricted in your AAD tenant. See [Delegate app registration permissions in Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/delegate-app-roles) for details on how to provide access.

**Open portal.azure.com.**

Sign in using your credentials.
